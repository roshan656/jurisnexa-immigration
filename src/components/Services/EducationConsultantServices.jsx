                In many countries, earning a degree is not the end of the educational journey. Students in certain fields, such as accounting, finance, engineering,
                law, medicine, dentistry, teaching, nursing, and marketing, are required to pass professional exams and gain experience in order to practice their
                professions. These exams are administered by professional associations, and upon passing, students become associates or fellows of the
                association and are allowed to use the association's initials after their names.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vinay Hari Education Consultant helps students register for these professional exams, track their progress, and facilitate the exams. We are
                committed to helping students achieve their professional goals.
